# Nextjs
# What I learned so far from reading documentation

1 - Create a project directory and initialize app via npx command

2 - Run the nextjs development server

3 - Brief revision on javascript, es6 and react

4 - Props, state and render

5 - Prefetching and routing

6 - Metadata, static files and CSS styling

7 - Using CSS modules to scope the styling of individual files

8 - Using Global CSS files by importing ONLY from _app.js file e.g to use the style sheet throught the project i can import App from '_app' for any page

9 - Prerendering and Data fetching
    Two types pre-rendering; Static Generation and Server-side Rendering
    Static Generation with data, and without data
